## Session 0 - Outline Document:

* Approach the game with an outline / elevator pitch in mind. (See pitch deck example below)
    *  When approaching the players about a game having an idea of the themes and aesthetics of the game can help sell it to the players. Compare these two descriptions:
        *  “A game where we are pirates and we sail the seven seas looting.” 
        *  “A game where the land is as risky as the oceans we sail. We eek out an existence with short raids of coastal villages and preying off other ships that limp along. ‘In a world of constant storms where nightmares slither beneath the surface, how will we survive?’”

    * The second options is much more evocative due to emphasizing aesthetic along with stating the theme. Throwing in a hook is a good way to get people interested as well.

* Establish and explain what the X-Card is. If running a game online having a player send a message privately or typing in chat X works well.
    * The X-Card is an index card with an X drawn on one side. When a player is uncomfortable with the content for any reason (including phobias, PTSD, and/or many more), they tap the card, or hold it up to show the DM. If the DM is confident that they know why they should move on, they do so. If I don’t know why, I might skip ahead to move things on, or I pull the person aside for clarification. 

* Microscope Preamble - This is borrowed from the Microscope RPG. The idea is that starting with the GM and then in any order everyone can add one thing, either a Yes or No.
    * Add something to the yes column if you think the other players would not expect it to be in the history, but you want to be able to include it
    * Add something to the no column if you think the other players would expect it to be in the history, but you don’t want it included
    *  If every player did add something (either a Yes or No), repeat step 1: each player has the option to go again. If someone opted not to add something, stop: your Palette is done. In the end, no player will have added two things more than anyone else.
    * Feel free to discuss and negotiate. No one should be unhappy about what winds up added or banned during the Preamble.

* Build Characters together and use bonds / links to associate them.
    * Use Bonds from Dungeon World and have the players link their characters to at least two other PC's.
    * If you do not have access to Dungeon World (Buy it, it's great) then a simple google search for "Dungeon World Bond Examples" will show you the general idea.
    * During the Microscope Preamble if something interesting comes up you might look at centering a bond around it.
        * Ex. Yes to Floating Monoliths. New Bond Opportunity: "You met _____ in the most likely of place, atop a floating monolith."

### Pitch Deck Example:
#### Guards of the Watch
***You are new recruits to the Guards of the Watch in Polis, an industrial gothic city of princes and thieves.***

Investigate the grisly death of the merchant Fildebrandt Croft and uncover the web of conspiracy being spun beneath the city by sinister minds.

**Inspiration:**
* Superpowered police procedurals like Hellboy, Gotham and Powers
* Monster of the week shows like Buffy and Supernatural
* Moody, violent noir like Pulp Fiction, Blade Runner and Sin City
